title: Incompatible technical debt cutting
---

I really like the following statement:

> This process *\[changing the aggression system\]* is necessarily imperfect, and we're inevitably going to find that some things are slightly easier and other things are slightly harder. This is regrettable, but we're absolutely not going back down the rabbit hole and re-complicating the new system to solve comparatively minor imbalances, because the overall cost is just not worth it.

I like it because it involves:

- Cutting back on technical debt;
- There's a realization here that there's no need to keep a suboptimal implementation alive, even if it means a change for the customers too -- if the customer (and/or the dev team) essentially gets something better in return;
- No fear! I experienced a lot of fear and uncertainty involving changing existing code, even if it had a good test coverage with good quality tests. They make the project rigid and feared. They certainly overcame that.

Bottom line is I wish more companies would think like that.
